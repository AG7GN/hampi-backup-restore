# nexus-backup-restore
 Script to backup the user's home folder to external storage
 
 This script will back up the contents of your home folder on your Nexus Pi with the exception of these subfolders: .cache, .debug, .dbus, .recently-used, .thumbnails, .xsession-errors, .Trash., config/pulse, .asoundrc
 
This script is handy when you're moving to a new image. In that case, run it on your Pi to create a backup of your home folder, then insert the SD card with the new image, run this scrip again and insert the USB stick with your backup, click Restore and follow the prompts.
